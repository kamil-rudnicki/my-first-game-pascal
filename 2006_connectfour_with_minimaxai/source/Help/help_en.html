  &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Rules</b><HR><BR>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; The game is played on a board with 7 columns and 6 rows, which is placed in a vertical position. <BR><BR>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; The players have 21 discs each, distinguished by color. The green player starts. The players take turns in dropping discs in one of the non-full columns. <BR><BR>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; The disc then occupies the lowest unoccupied square on that column. <BR><BR>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; A player wins by placing four of their own discs consecutively in a line (row, column or diagonal), which ends the game. The game ends in a draw if the board is filled completely without any player winning.
